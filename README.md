### Setup DevIL SDK
Download DevIL 1.8.0 SDK from http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php "DevIL 1.8.0 SDK for Windows" archive and extract its content to `external/devilsdk`.

### Setup FBX SDK

Edit `external/fbxsdk/fbxsdk-config.cmake` and edit the paths of those two lines below to point to the location of your FBX SDK installation:
```bash
set(FBXSDK_LIB "C:/Program\ Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX\ SDK/2019.5/lib/vs2015/x86")
set(FBXSDK_INCLUDE "C:/Program\ Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX\ SDK/2019.5/include")
